; This is a macro
; arguments can be either pointers, or a just numbers
macro add(arg1, arg2, arg3) {
    LRA arg1        ; load register ACC with 'arg1'
    ADD arg2        ; add 'arg2' to ACC
    SRA arg3        ; store ACC to arg3
}

; This is a macro overloading
macro add(arg1, arg2) {
    LRA arg1        ; load register ACC with 'arg1'
    ADD arg2        ; add 'arg2' to ACC
}
