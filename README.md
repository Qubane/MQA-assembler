# MQA assembler
Mini Quantum Assembler - it assembles Mini Quantum's assembly instructions.<br/>
Mini Quantum - MQ - 8bit CPU that was made entirely in Scrap Mechanic, using vanilla logic gates.<br/>
Information on MQ can be found on my discord servers:<br/>

<br/>If you want just the instruction set go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sl82E1pRsVYuFbP9roWOJOsSJ4JLtFiOXaD3Rq9oaJI/edit#gid=0)
<br/>If you want the computer check this [repository](https://github.com/UltraQbik/SMC-MQ-CPU)

# Compatibility
This repo will work with python 3.10+ (doesn't work on python â‰¤ 3.9 because of type hinting syntax)<br/>
No additional libraries required, it uses the default ones, preinstalled with python.
# Building
1. git clone https://github.com/UltraQbik/MQA-assembler
2. cd MQA-assembler
3. python -m build
4. pip install dist/\*.whl
<br/>Now you can run it through either mqa or python -m mqa
# Code examples
Code examples are located in directory 'examples', there you will find some examples of assembly code written for MQ's
